Subject: [PATCH 06/18] make AVX2-detection platform-independent (#1600)

Summary:
In the context of https://github.com/conda-forge/faiss-split-feedstock/issues/23, I discussed with some of the conda-folks how we should support AVX2 (and potentially other builds) for faiss. In the meantime, we'd like to follow the model that faiss itself is using (i.e. build with AVX2 and without and then load the corresponding library at runtime depending on CPU capabilities).

Since windows support for this is missing (and the other stuff is also non-portable in `loader.py`), I chased down `numpy.distutils.cpuinfo`, which is pretty outdated, and opened: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/18058

While the [private API](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/18058#issuecomment-749852711) is obviously something that _could_ change at any time, I still think it's better than platform-dependent shenanigans.

Opening this here to ideally upstream this right away, rather than carrying patches in the conda-forge feedstock.

TODO:
* [ ] adapt conda recipe for windows in this repo to also build avx2 version
